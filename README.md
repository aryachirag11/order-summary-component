## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- 
### What I learned
Basic HTML and tags and most importantly how to style HTML structure using CSS

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<button class="proceed-button">Prceed to payment</button>
        <button class="cancel-button">Cancel Order</button>
```
```css

.plan-container {
  font-size: 16px;
  background-color: var(--very-pale-blue);
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development
I want to learn the some more basic functions of CSS and HTML, example styling buttons and different containers





### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) - This helped me to discover this simple beginner level project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [FrontEnd_Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) - This is an amazing website with a lot of front-end challenges. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
